False Prophecy of False Hero
----------------------------

This is going to be 2D RPG dungeon crawler, which features high modability by changing files. 

Maps, items and enemies are supposed to be modified by user. This includes textures. 

As for now, maps can be up to 512x512 tiles, each tile is 32x32, which gives 16384x16384px big maps. And I still can go for more if nessessaary.



HowTo Play. Or pretend to play
------------------------------
Arrows to move hero around - left to go left, right to go right, no magic here.
Enter to generate next map, if you are too lazy to move where are you supposed to go.
NUMPAD to move aroud camera - KP4 to move left, KP6 to move right, no magic here.
NUMPAD5 to center view on hero.
